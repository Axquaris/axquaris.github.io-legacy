							<h2>AxNet</h2>
							<p>This year for the robotics team at LJHS I am planning to use neural models to help control the robot in the upcoming competition. In past competitions we have had many issues with human error and network latency in driving our robot, the best fix for this is to make the robot capable of autonomously reacting to it's environment and performing actions in response.</p>
							<p>This is where neural models come in, NMs are custom-tailored networks of neurons that are capable of intelligently interpreting sensor data, making decisions, and putting them into action somewhat like the human brain does. All people have a complex network of about 86 billion neurons that are massively interconnected to form our nervous system, these networks are vastly more complex than Neural Models, however their basic units (neurons) are a good basis for understanding NMs.</p>
							<h3>The Biological Neuron</h3>
							<p>Shown in Figure A, dendrites transmit information or electrical pulses received from other neurons to the soma, the electrical pulse then travels along the axon and to another cell, artificial neurons function in a similar way.</p>
