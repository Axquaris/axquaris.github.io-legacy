<h2>AxNet</h2>
<p>&emsp;This year for the robotics team at LJHS I am planning to use neural models to help control the robot in the upcoming competition. In past competitions we have had many issues with human error and network latency in driving our robot, the best fix for this is to make the robot capable of autonomously reacting to it's environment and performing actions in response.</p>
<p>&emsp;This is where neural models come in, NMs are custom-tailored networks of neurons that are capable of intelligently interpreting sensor data, making decisions, and putting them into action somewhat like the human brain does. All people have a complex network of about 86 billion neurons that are massively interconnected to form our nervous system, these networks are vastly more complex than Neural Models, however their basic units (neurons) are a good basis for understanding NMs.</p>

<h3>The Biological Neuron</h3>
<p>&emsp;Shown in Figure A, dendrites transmit information or electrical pulses received from other neurons to the soma, the electrical pulse then travels along the axon and to another cell, artificial neurons function in a similar way.</p>
<h3>The Artificial Neuron</h3>
<p>&emsp;In artificial neurons (Figure B) an array of inputs (Xi) is taken, these inputs are then multiplied by a corresponding set of weights (Wi), this is the "dendrite" of the neuron. Next the inputs are added together and fed to an activation function f(Xi) which is usually a logistic function or hyperbolic tangent (tanh). This step can be represented by the soma of a biological neuron. Finally, the result of the activation function is sent to whatever other neurons it is connected to. This behaves like an axon.</p>
<h3>Neural Networks</h3>
<p>&emsp;Neural networks are multiple neurons linked up in an orderly fashion such as in Figure C. This figure has two neurons that are interconnected, the different W values represent the weights of the different inputs. The neurons also have B variables that represent biases being added to their sum functions. Below is a program that I have written simulating the network shown in Figure C. It's various sliders do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		W CATEGORY
		<ul>
			<li>the <span style="color:#535154; font-weight:bold">GREY</span> slider sets W2 to it's own value and W1 to the negative of it's value</li>
			<li><span style="color:#da7c30; font-weight:bold">ORANGE</span> slider sets W4 to it's current value</li>
			<li><span style="color:#396ab1; font-weight:bold">BLUE</span> slider controls W3</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		B CATEGORY
		<ul>
			<li>the <span style="color:#da7c30; font-weight:bold">ORANGE</span> slider controls B2</li>
			<li>the <span style="color:#396ab1; font-weight:bold">BLUE</span> slider sets B1 to it's value</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#da7c30; font-weight:bold">ORANGE</span> represents the neuron on the left, or neuron1.<br/>
<span style="color:#396ab1; font-weight:bold">BLUE</span> represents the neuron on the right, or neuron2.<br/>
<span style="color:#535154; font-weight:bold">GREY</span> represents both neurons or the sum of their outputs.<br/>
