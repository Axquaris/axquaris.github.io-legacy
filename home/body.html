<p class="lead">This is my website, here I showcase my various expiriments.</p>
<p>&emsp;My first expiriment was Ecoblobs, a simulation of a bacterial ecosystem. I came up with the idea while reading Daniel Shiffman's <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a>. My development of the project started in the summer of 2015 and went on for about two months. After I had completed this project I moved on to ModularShip, a game about building and piloting a spaceship to fight against AI. This project has been in the works for over two months and utilizes my first unofficial library for Processing, AxNet. I made Axnet as a framework for building and running neural networks, and I am working on using it to make intelligence for ModularShip. During thanksgiving break I have learned to use HTML/CSS, created this website and am currently working on updates for ModularShip.</p>
